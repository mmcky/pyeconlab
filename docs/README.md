PyEconLab Documentation
=======================

This is the documentation for PyEconLab

Currently this is a built document. The following command should be issued at the root level of the repo: 

``sphinx-apidoc -o docs pyeconlab``.

**Note:** ``-f`` may need to be specified to overwrite the generated rst pages

Future Work
-----------
  1. Construct a ``make.py`` file for building the documentation (similar to Pandas). This may or may not replace the sphinx MakeFile
